# DigitalH Back-end Challenge

## 🎉 Welcome to the DigitalH Challenge!

🚀 Congratulations on making it this far! This challenge is designed to assess your ability to build a **full-stack user management application** using **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **Next.js**, and **Prisma**. Your mission? Create an intuitive and engaging **public user directory** where anyone can add their information and see a list of all users.

## 📌 Overview

Your task is to build a full-stack application that allows users to **add their profiles publicly**, view all users, and explore the community. The application should have an intuitive UI that displays all users in a **fun, engaging, and interactive way**.

## 💡 Requirements

### **Tech Stack:**
- **Node.js** (backend runtime)
- **TypeScript** (strictly required for type safety)
- **Prisma ORM** (for database management)
- **Express.js** (for handling API routes)
- **PostgreSQL** (recommended database)
- **Next.js** (for frontend development)
- **Shadcn UI** (for a clean and modern UI)
- **Docker** (optional for database setup)

## ✨ Features to Implement

### Backend (Express + Prisma)
- [ ] **Create a user** with a name, email, optional bio, and avatar.
- [ ] **Retrieve all users** from the database.
- [ ] **Retrieve a single user** by their ID.
- [ ] **Use Express.js API routes** to handle CRUD operations.
- [ ] **Validate request data**.

### Frontend (Next.js + Shadcn UI)
- [ ] **Home Page:**
  - Show **total number of users** in the system.
  - Display **quick actions** (Add a new user, View all users).
